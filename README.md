# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to demostrate skills and understanding with unsupervised machine learning.  Using the supplied csv dataset we were able to create an analysis for our client who is interested in entering into the cryptocurrencey market.  From this dataset we were able to extract information on currently traded cryptocurriencies.

## Resources
* Crypto_Dataset.csv
* Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Fig 1. Clustered Coins

By using unsupervised machine learning to process the cryptocurrencies, we were able to construct a clustering algorithm.  From these algorithms we determined that there were 532 tradable currencies.  (Fig. 1)

From this analysis we were able to extract the total number of coins mined out of the total coins and plot them. (Fig. 2)

## Summary
Despite the provided dataset, there wasn't much trend data that we were able to extract.  We would need a more thorough analysis, perhaps for specific coins over a given time frame for a better understanding of which coins are better potential investments.
